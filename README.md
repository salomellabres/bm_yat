**Abstract:** 
Amyloid fibrils, which are aggregates of misfolded proteins characterized by β-sheet-rich structures, are implicated in several neurodegenerative and systemic pathologies, including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases and type II diabetes. Traditional amyloid markers, such as Congo Red and Thioflavin T, are widely used for amyloid detection but present limitations, particularly in cellular assays, due to spectral interference and aggregation inhibition. This study investigates YAT2150, a novel fluorescent dye with enhanced amyloid-binding specificity and sensitivity, as a potential alternative to conventional dyes. We evaluated YAT2150’s efficacy for detecting amyloid aggregates in both in vitro and in cellulo assays. First, we compared its fluorescence intensity and binding specificity to that of Thioflavin T in amyloid fibril assays, demonstrating that YAT2150 exhibits high affinity and selectivity for amyloid structures, with minimal interference from non-amyloid proteins. Furthermore, we explored YAT2150’s utility in *Escherichia coli* as a model system for studying protein aggregation and amyloid formation in a cellular context. Our findings indicate that YAT2150 effectively labels amyloid-like inclusion bodies in *E. coli*, producing a robust fluorescence signal with low background noise. These results suggest that YAT2150 is a promising new tool for amyloid research, offering greater sensitivity compared to traditional dyes, even in complex cellular environments.
